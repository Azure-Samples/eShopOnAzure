## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Clone the eShop repository: https://github.com/dotnet/eshopOnAzure
- (Windows only) Install Visual Studio. Visual Studio contains tooling support for .NET Aspire that you will want to have. [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).
  - During installation, ensure that the following are selected:
    - `ASP.NET and web development` workload.
    - `.NET Aspire SDK` component in `Individual components`.
- Install the latest [.NET 8 SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/installer#installers-and-binaries)
- On Mac/Linux (or if not using Visual Studio), install the Aspire workload with the following commands:
```powershell
dotnet workload update
dotnet workload install aspire
dotnet restore eShop.Web.slnf
```
- Install & start Docker Desktop:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Running the solution

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to ensure that Docker is started

* (Windows only) Run the application from Visual Studio:
 - Open the `eShop.Web.slnf` file in Visual Studio
 - Ensure that `eShop.AppHost.csproj` is your startup project
 - Hit Ctrl-F5 to launch Aspire

* Or run the application from your terminal:
```powershell
dotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj
```
then look for lines like this in the console output in order to find the URL to open the Aspire dashboard:
```sh
Now listening on: http://localhost:18848
```

### Sample data

The sample catalog data is defined in [catalog.json](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/blob/main/src/Catalog.API/Setup/catalog.json). Those product names, descriptions, and brand names are fictional and were generated using [GPT-35-Turbo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt), and the corresponding [product images](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/tree/main/src/Catalog.API/Pics) were generated using [DALLÂ·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3).

## Use Azure Developer CLI

You can use the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) to run this project on Azure with only a few commands. Follow the next instructions:

- Install [azd](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install).
- Log in `azd` (if you haven't done it before) to your Azure account:
```sh
azd auth login
```
- Initialize `azd` from the root of the repo.
```sh
azd init
```
- During init:
  - Select `Use code in the current directory`. Azd will automatically detect the Dotnet Aspire project.
  - Confirm `.Net (Aspire)` and continue.
  - Select which services to expose to the Internet (exposing `webapp` is enough to test the sample).
  - Finalize the initialization by giving a name to your environment.

- Create Azure resources and deploy the sample by running:
```sh
azd up
```
Notes:
  - The operation takes a few minutes the first time it is ever run for an environment.
  - At the end of the process, `azd` will display the `url` for the webapp. Follow that link to test the sample.
  - You can run `azd up` after saving changes to the sample to re-deploy and update the sample.
  - Report any issues to [azure-dev](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues) repo.
  - [FAQ and troubleshoot](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/troubleshoot?tabs=Browser) for azd.
